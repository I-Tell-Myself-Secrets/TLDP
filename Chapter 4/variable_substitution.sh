# Variable Substitution

# The name of a variable is a placeholder for its value, the data it holds. Referencing (retrieving) its value is called variable substitution.

# In order to carefully distinguish between the name of a variable and its value, the following must be noted: variable1 is the name of a variable, and $variable1 is a reference to its value, the data or item it contians.
variable1=100
echo variable1	# variable1
echo $variable1 # 100
