#!/bin/bash

# Slashes (/ and \)

# Filename Path Separator (/): Separator the components of a filename (as in /home/bozo/projects/Makefile). This is also the division arithmetic operator.

# Escape (\): A quoting mechanism for single characters. For instance, \X escapes the character X. This has the effect of "quoting" X, equivalent to 'X'. The \ may be used to quote "and', so they are expressed literally.
