# TLDP
A repository for many of the concepts found throughout the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide of the TLDP site.

The link is: https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html.

Will check some information on another site. It seems that I may incorrectly learn future concepts incorrectly, yet this is the most actual version. Anyhow, will check other resources and see if this resource is indeed bad.
